# Checkboxes for Grouped Selection with Submit

## Description

When users need to pick one or multiple related options from a list before confirming with an action button, use checkboxes — not toggle switches. Checkboxes communicate "select then confirm," while toggles imply each option takes effect immediately.

## Why it matters

- **Clear expectations**: Checkboxes tell users "nothing happens until you press the button"
- **No false immediacy**: Toggles imply instant activation, which is misleading when a submit step is required
- **Batch processing**: Checkboxes are the natural choice for actions processed together (export, filter, apply)

## When to apply

- Export dialogs where users pick which data to include
- Filter panels with an "Apply" button
- Multi-select forms submitted as a batch
- Any grouped selection followed by a confirmation action

## When not to apply

- Independent settings that take effect immediately (use toggle switches)
- Single yes/no options with instant effect (use a toggle switch)
