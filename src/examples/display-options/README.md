## Description

When users need to select from only a few options, showing all choices upfront is more efficient and user-friendly than hiding them in a dropdown. Hiding a small set of options forces users to click just to discover 1–4 items, adding unnecessary steps and cognitive load.

## Why it matters

- **Efficiency**: Users can see all available options immediately without extra clicks.
- **Clarity**: Reduces uncertainty since all choices are visible at once.
- **Error reduction**: Less chance of overlooking or misselecting an option.
- **Cognitive load**: Users don’t have to remember hidden options or interact unnecessarily.
- **Mobile experience**: Easier to scan and select on touch devices without dealing with dropdown menus.

## When to apply

- Selection involves a small, fixed set of options (≈ 2–5 max)
- Options are short, distinct, and easy to scan
- Options are unlikely to grow or change frequently
- Quick comparisons between options are helpful

## When not to apply

- Large or dynamic lists of options
- Options that require search or filtering
- Long or similar option labels that need more space to read
