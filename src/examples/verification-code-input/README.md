# Verification Code Paste Support

## Description

When users need to enter a verification code (OTP, 2FA), they should be able to paste the entire code at once instead of typing each digit individually.

## Why it matters

- **Speed**: Users often receive codes via SMS or email and want to copy-paste them quickly
- **Error reduction**: Manual digit-by-digit entry is prone to typos
- **Mobile experience**: Pasting is much easier than switching keyboards and typing on small screens
- **Accessibility**: Some users have difficulty with precise typing

## When to apply

- Two-factor authentication (2FA) inputs
- Email/phone verification codes
- One-time passwords (OTP)
- Any multi-digit code entry

## When not to apply

- PIN codes that users should memorize (security consideration)
- Cases where you explicitly want to slow down entry (CAPTCHA-like scenarios)
