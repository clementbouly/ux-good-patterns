## Description

When users need to select from only a few options, showing all choices upfront is more efficient than hiding them in a dropdown. A dropdown for 3 options means: click to open, scan, click to select. Visible options mean: scan, click. One interaction saved, zero cognitive load added.

## Why it matters

- **Efficiency**: One click instead of two
- **Clarity**: Users instantly see what's available without interaction
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side options are easier to compare than a sequential list
- **Touch-friendly**: Larger tap targets than dropdown items

## Choosing the right pattern

| Pattern | Best for |
|---------|----------|
| **Radio buttons** | Simple choices, compact space, form-like contexts |
| **Selectable cards** | Options with descriptions, visual emphasis, standalone selections |
| **Segmented control** | Binary or ternary choices, toolbar-style UI |
| **Dropdown** | 6+ options, space-constrained layouts, less important selections |

## When to apply

- 2–5 mutually exclusive options
- Options are short and distinct
- The choice is important enough to deserve screen real estate
- Users benefit from comparing options visually

## When not to apply

- 6+ options (consider a dropdown or combobox)
- Very limited horizontal space
- The selection is secondary to the main task
- Options change frequently or are data-driven
