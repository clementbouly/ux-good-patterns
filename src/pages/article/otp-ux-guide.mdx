# The Complete Guide to OTP UX

One-Time Passwords (OTP) are everywhere: account verification, two-factor authentication, password resets. Yet, the UX around them is often an afterthought. This guide covers **4 key areas** to make your OTP flow seamless.

---

## 1. Email Design: Make the Code Scannable

Before users even interact with your form, they need to find the code in their inbox. This is where many services fail.

### Why it matters

- Users scan emails in **2-3 seconds** looking for the code
- A code buried in text forces them to read the entire email
- Clear visual hierarchy = faster copy/paste = less frustration

### Best practices

1. **Center the code** with generous whitespace
2. **Use a large, monospace font** for the digits
3. **Add visual contrast** (background box, different color)
4. **Show expiration time** clearly
5. **Keep the email short** — users don't read marketing copy when they need a code

## 2. Input Design: Separate Fields vs Single Input

The visual design of your OTP input affects perceived usability.

<ExampleEmbed id="verification-code-input" client:load />

### The trade-off

- **Separate fields**: More visual feedback, feels modern, but can be tricky to implement
- **Single input**: Simpler, but less engaging

Most modern implementations use **separate fields with auto-advance** — each digit gets its own box, and focus moves automatically.

## 3. Auto-Submit: Remove the Extra Click

Once all digits are entered, why make users click "Verify"?

<ExampleEmbed id="auto-submit-code" client:load />

### Why auto-submit wins

- **Saves one interaction** (no button click needed)
- **Feels faster** even if the actual time is the same
- **Reduces cognitive load** — users don't have to decide when to submit

### Implementation notes

- Trigger validation when `value.length === maxLength`
- Show a loading state immediately
- Handle errors gracefully (clear input, show message)

---

## 4. Paste Button: The Hidden Accelerator

On mobile, pasting requires multiple steps: long press → context menu → tap "Paste". A visible paste button reduces this to a single tap.

<ExampleEmbed id="paste-otp-code" client:load />

### The browser permission question

Yes, the Clipboard API triggers a permission prompt. But:

1. **It's one-time** — users won't see it again after accepting
2. **It's contextual** — the prompt appears right after clicking "Paste"
3. **It's still faster** than typing 6 digits manually

### When to use it

- **Desktop**: Highly recommended (email codes, password managers)
- **Mobile**: Optional fallback — `autocomplete="one-time-code"` handles most cases

---

## The Ultimate OTP Flow

Combine all patterns for the best experience:

1. **Email**: Code prominently displayed, easy to copy
2. **Input**: Separate fields with auto-advance
3. **Behavior**: Auto-submit when complete
4. **Fallback**: Visible paste button for power users

The goal is simple: **minimize the time between receiving the code and being verified**.

## Technical Checklist

- [ ] Use `autocomplete="one-time-code"` for mobile autofill
- [ ] Support paste (Ctrl+V) in all input fields
- [ ] Auto-advance focus between fields
- [ ] Auto-submit when all digits are entered
- [ ] Show clear error states with retry option
- [ ] Consider a visible paste button for desktop users
- [ ] Design emails with the code as the visual focal point
