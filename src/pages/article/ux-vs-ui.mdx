# Understanding UX vs UI — By Example

The same form, four different implementations. Each cell combines a level of **UX** (how it works) and **UI** (how it looks).

<div className="mb-6">
<span className="inline-block bg-primary text-primary-foreground text-xs font-medium px-2 py-1 rounded mb-2">👇 Try it yourself</span>
<p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-1">Type in the email, select a country, write more than 35 characters in motivation, and notice the buttons.</p>
</div>

<UxVsUiGrid lang="en" client:load>

## What's the Difference?

- **UI** is how the product **looks** — colors, typography, spacing, visual polish
- **UX** is how the product **works** — interactions, flows, error handling, user mental models

A product can have beautiful UI but terrible UX (frustrating to use despite looking good). It can also have great UX but poor UI (works well but looks dated or inconsistent).

The goal is to have **both**.

## What Makes Each Version Different?

### Bad UX Patterns (top row)

1. **Aggressive email validation**: Shows "Invalid email format" on every keystroke. Type "j" and you immediately see an error. This is jarring and unhelpful — the user hasn't finished typing yet.

2. **Question in placeholder**: The motivation field uses the placeholder for the question instead of the label. Once users start typing, the question disappears — they can't refer back to what was asked.

3. **Long dropdown without search**: 30 countries in a plain dropdown. Users must scroll through the entire list to find their country. No way to type and filter.

4. **Silent text truncation**: The motivation field has a 20-character limit, but it's enforced silently. Text simply stops appearing. No indication of the limit beforehand.

5. **No button hierarchy**: Submit and Cancel look identical. Users must read the labels to distinguish the primary action from the secondary one.

6. **Silent submit failure**: Clicking submit does nothing if fields are invalid — no feedback, no indication of what's wrong. Users are left wondering why nothing happened.

### Good UX Patterns (bottom row)

1. **Validation on blur**: Email is only validated when the user leaves the field. No premature errors while typing.

2. **Helpful placeholders**: Examples show users what format is expected.

3. **Searchable dropdown**: Users can type to filter countries. Finding "Switzerland" takes 2 keystrokes instead of 20 scroll actions.

4. **Overflow text highlighted**: Text beyond the limit is highlighted in red, making it easy to see what to remove.

5. **Clear button hierarchy**: Submit is visually prominent (filled). Cancel is secondary (outline). Users instantly know which action is primary.

6. **Validation on submit**: Form cannot be submitted with errors — all fields are validated and errors are shown.

7. **Required field indicators**: Asterisks (*) next to labels clearly show which fields are mandatory before users start filling the form.

### Bad UI Patterns (left column)

- Browser-default styling (`all: revert`)
- No consistent spacing or typography
- No focus states or visual feedback
- Looks like a form from 1998

### Good UI Patterns (right column)

- Modern component library (shadcn/ui)
- Consistent spacing, borders, and focus rings
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional, polished appearance

## Key Takeaways

| Aspect | UX (Experience) | UI (Interface) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Focus | How it works | How it looks |
| Concerns | Flows, timing, feedback, error handling | Colors, typography, spacing, visual polish |
| Bad example | Validating while typing | Unstyled browser defaults |
| Good example | Validating on blur | Modern design system |

### The Ideal: Good UX + Good UI

The bottom-right form combines both:
- Thoughtful interaction patterns that respect user behavior
- Polished visual design that communicates hierarchy and state

This is what we should aim for. **A beautiful interface that frustrates users is a failure. A usable interface that looks amateur undermines trust.**
