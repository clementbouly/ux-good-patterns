# The Complete Guide to OTP UX

One-Time Passwords (OTP) are everywhere: account verification, two-factor authentication, password resets. Yet, the UX around them is often an afterthought. This guide covers **4 key areas** to make your OTP flow seamless.

## 1. Email Design: Make the Code Scannable

Before users even interact with your form, they need to find the code in their inbox. This is where many services fail.

### Why it matters

- Users scan emails in **2-3 seconds** looking for the code
- A code buried in text forces them to read the entire email
- Clear visual hierarchy = faster copy/paste = less frustration

### Best practices

1. **Center the code** with generous whitespace
2. **Use a large, monospace font** for the digits
3. **Add visual contrast** (background box, different color)
4. **Show expiration time** clearly
5. **Keep the email short** — users don't read marketing copy when they need a code

---

## 2. Paste Support: The Make-or-Break Feature

Users almost always have the code in their clipboard (from email, SMS, or password manager). If they can't paste it, frustration kicks in immediately.

<ExampleEmbed id="verification-code-input" client:load />

### The problem with naive implementations

Many "separate fields" implementations break paste:
- Each input only accepts one character
- Pasting fills only the first field and discards the rest
- Users are forced to type digit by digit

### The solution

Handle the `paste` event properly:
1. Intercept `Ctrl+V` / `Cmd+V` on any field
2. Extract digits from the pasted content
3. Distribute them across all fields automatically

Modern OTP libraries (like `input-otp`) handle this out of the box. If building custom inputs, **paste support is non-negotiable**.

## 3. Auto-Submit: Remove the Extra Click

Once all digits are entered, why make users click "Verify"?

<ExampleEmbed id="auto-submit-code" client:load />

### Why auto-submit wins

- **Saves one interaction** (no button click needed)
- **Feels faster** even if the actual time is the same
- **Reduces cognitive load** — users don't have to decide when to submit

### Implementation notes

- Trigger validation when `value.length === maxLength`
- Show a loading state immediately
- Handle errors gracefully (clear input, show message)

## 4. Paste Button: The Hidden Accelerator

On mobile, pasting requires multiple steps: long press → context menu → tap "Paste". A visible paste button reduces this to a single tap.

<ExampleEmbed id="paste-otp-code" client:load />

### The browser permission question

Yes, the Clipboard API triggers a permission prompt. But:

1. **It's one-time** — users won't see it again after accepting
2. **It's contextual** — the prompt appears right after clicking "Paste"
3. **It's still faster** than typing 6 digits manually

### When to use it

- **Desktop**: Highly recommended (email codes, password managers)
- **Mobile**: Optional fallback — `autocomplete="one-time-code"` handles most cases

## The Ultimate OTP Flow

Combine all patterns for the best experience:

1. **Email**: Code prominently displayed, easy to copy
2. **Input**: Full paste support (Ctrl+V fills all fields)
3. **Behavior**: Auto-submit when complete
4. **Fallback**: Visible paste button for power users

The goal is simple: **minimize the time between receiving the code and being verified**.
