## Description

Using a standard dropdown/select with too many options makes it difficult for users to find and select the desired value efficiently.

## Why it matters

- **Efficiency**: Scanning a long list is slower than typing or searching
- **Cognitive load**: Users must compare many similar options at once
- **Error rate**: Higher risk of selecting the wrong option
- **Accessibility**: Long dropdowns are hard to navigate with keyboard or screen readers
- **Mobile experience**: Native selects with many options are especially frustrating

## When to apply

- Dropdowns with a small, fixed set of options (≈ 7–10 max)
- Options that are well-known, short, and easy to scan
- Mutually exclusive choices (status, priority, yes/no)
- When the list is unlikely to grow over time

## When not to apply

- Dropdowns with many or unbounded options
- Data-driven lists (users, products, etc.)
- When users know the value and could type it faster
- When options are long, similar, or frequently changing
