# The UX Speed Challenge

**Can you feel the difference?** Complete the same task in both versions and see how micro-frictions impact your speed.

## Why this matters

Every extra click, every missing shortcut, every unoptimized interaction adds up. In isolation, each friction seems minor. Combined, they create a measurably slower — and more frustrating — experience.

### The compound effect

If each friction adds just **0.5 seconds**:

| Frictions | Time added | Daily impact (100 uses) |
|-----------|------------|------------------------|
| 1         | 0.5s       | 50 seconds             |
| 3         | 1.5s       | 2.5 minutes            |
| 5         | 2.5s       | **4+ minutes**         |

Now multiply this across your entire user base.

### The psychological cost

Beyond raw time, bad UX creates:

- **Cognitive load** — Users must think about *how* to use the interface instead of *what* they want to do
- **Frustration** — Small annoyances accumulate into negative brand perception
- **Errors** — More steps = more opportunities for mistakes

## Key takeaways

1. **Auto-focus inputs** when a modal opens — users expect to type immediately
2. **Support multiple dismissal methods** — X button, click outside, Escape key
3. **Provide copy buttons** — don't make users select text manually
4. **Auto-submit when possible** — if you have all the data, why wait for a click?
