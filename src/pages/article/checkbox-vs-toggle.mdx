# Checkbox vs Toggle Switch: When to Use Which

Checkboxes and toggle switches look similar — both let users turn options on and off. But they communicate fundamentally different things to users. Using the wrong one creates subtle confusion that erodes trust in your interface.

The core distinction is simple: **toggles are for immediate effect, checkboxes are for deferred selection** <SourceRef id={1} client:load />.

---

## Rule 1: Toggles for Immediate, Independent Settings

Toggle switches work like light switches: flip it, and the change happens now. No save button, no confirmation step. The user expects instant feedback.

This makes them ideal for:
- App settings (dark mode, notifications, autoplay)
- Feature flags that users control
- Any on/off state that takes effect the moment you interact

<ExampleEmbed id="toggle-immediate-effect" client:load />

When you use checkboxes for these settings, you introduce doubt. Did checking the box already activate it? Do I need to click Save? The component's visual language conflicts with the expected behavior.

---

## Rule 2: Checkboxes for Grouped Selection with Submit

Checkboxes originate from paper forms — you check what applies, then hand in the form. That mental model still holds. When multiple options feed into a single action (submit, export, apply filters), checkboxes are the right choice.

<ExampleEmbed id="checkbox-grouped-selection" client:load />

Toggle switches in this context create a false sense of immediacy. Users may think each toggle is already taking effect, when in reality nothing happens until they click the action button.

---

## Rule 3: Checkboxes for Hierarchical Options

Checkboxes have a unique capability that toggles lack: the **indeterminate state**. When a parent option partially covers its children (some selected, some not), the checkbox can display a third visual state — neither fully checked nor unchecked.

This is essential for tree structures, permission systems, and any nested selection.

<ExampleEmbed id="checkbox-hierarchical-options" client:load />

Toggle switches are strictly binary — on or off. They have no way to express "some but not all children are selected."

## Quick Reference

| Criteria | Toggle Switch | Checkbox |
|----------|:---:|:---:|
| Immediate effect | Yes | No |
| Needs a submit button | No | Yes |
| Grouped multi-selection | No | Yes |
| Supports indeterminate state | No | Yes |
| Hierarchical (parent/child) | No | Yes |

## Key Takeaway

The choice between checkbox and toggle is not aesthetic — it is semantic. Each component carries expectations about how it behaves. When those expectations match reality, the interface feels intuitive. When they don't, users hesitate, make errors, and lose confidence.

**Use toggles when the effect is immediate. Use checkboxes when the action is deferred or hierarchical.**
